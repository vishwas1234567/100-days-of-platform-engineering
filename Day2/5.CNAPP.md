Today a modern kid understands VM as a part of the Datacenter rather than thinking it as a cloud service to be working and deploying the application on we talk all new services but we don't rethink security - here is a guide to the modern kind who think VM is obsolete and thinks Kubernetes is everything.

A Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) ,what is it exactly?
Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP), Cloud Service Network Security (CSNS), and Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) are all components of the cloud-native security model known as Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP).

In contrast to a plethora of tools, CNAPP underlines the need for businesses to concentrate on cloud-native security solutions that offer a comprehensive lifecycle approach to application security.

The CNAPP (Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform) Model's Objectives with the publication of their Innovation Insight for Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms research, Gartner helped make CNAPP a well-known security buzzword in the Security Industry. But CNAPP isn't only a newly released security tool with some buzz. The CNAPP platform aims to provide contemporary businesses with cloud-native workloads with a single comprehensive security solution in place of several disparate, standalone technologies.

In particular, Gartner saw the need for businesses to unify tools and security platforms and handle security and compliance as a continuum between operations and security teams. As a result, the Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform model was developed. From that angle, CNAPP is a logical progression for "shift left" security and DevSecOps.

Why Is Having A Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) Important?
Multiple, fragmented solutions will inevitably have integration difficulties and visibility gaps. DevSecOps teams will have to do more work as a result, and enterprise workload observability will suffer. Enterprises can solve these problems and enhance their overall security posture by utilising a CNAPP.

Particularly, a CNAPP strategy offers the following advantages: (this is a referee that you can also consider outside of the CNCF Fraternity)

"Cloud-native" security: The traditional "castle-and-moat" networks with well-defined parameters security solutions were created for are not suited for the current company with cloud-native workloads. CNAPP is designed with contemporary "cloud-native" technology, including containers and serverless security, in mind. It integrates with CICD pipelines and offers protection across public and private clouds as well as on-premises,greater visibility For cloud-native workloads, there are numerous security scanning, monitoring, and observability options available.

Providing end-to-end visibility throughout an enterprise's application architecture distinguishes CNAPP from its competitors. A CNAPP solution, for instance, can prioritise alarms that represent the most risk to an organisation thanks to end-to-end visibility and precise detail on configurations, technology stacks, and identities.

Trigger restrictions and Rethink Chaos Engineering: One of the most frequent hazards facing enterprise applications is an incorrect configuration of secrets, cloud workloads, containers, or Kubernetes (K8s) clusters. Enterprises may proactively scan for, identify, and swiftly address security and compliance problems brought on by misconfigurations thanks to CNAPP systems.

The Fundamental Elements Of CNAPP
A summary of the three main parts of CNAPP is as follows:

Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)
Cloud Service Network Security (CSNS) 
Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP)
Let's examine each in more detail and how CNAPP unites them.

CSPM - Cloud Security Posture Management: Visualizations and security assessment 

Utilizing security assessments and automated compliance monitoring, Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) enables businesses to automate the discovery and correction of security problems. CSPMs can also find configuration errors that could result in data breaches. Furthermore, by assisting businesses in classifying and inventorying assets across IaaS, SaaS, and PaaS platforms, CSPMs offer comprehensive cloud visibility.

CSNS - Cloud Service Network Security: Security for cloud-native networks

Although it isn't typically included as a component of CNAPP, Cloud Service Network Security (CSNS) is a crucial feature of total cloud-native security and genuine CNAPP solutions. Regarding the changing network perimeters typical of cloud-native applications, CSNS offers cloud network security features. CSNS offers granular segmentation and safeguards both East-West and North-South traffic. Typical illustrations of CSNS functions include:

Next-generation firewall (NGFW)
Load balancers 
Denial of Service (DoS) protection 
Web Application and API protection (WAAP)
SSL/TLS inspection 
Workload threat protection in the modern era - Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP)

Workloads deployed across public, private, and hybrid clouds are protected by Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP) systems. Enterprises can integrate security solutions early in the application development lifecycle and continually throughout thanks to CWPP, which enables them to move security left. Solutions in this category first identify workloads in a company's on-premises and cloud infrastructure. After that, they scan them to find security flaws and offer solutions to fix the vulnerabilities. CWPPs offer security features for workloads such as malware detection, network segmentation, and runtime protection.

Integration Is What Differentiates CNAPP

Although there are other cloud-native security products available, CNAPP stands out because it unifies end-to-end cloud-native security across all corporate workloads. Here are just a few of the several security features that a CNAPP platform might offer, from "code" through "deploy" throughout a CI/CD pipeline:

Commit and code: Third-party library scans and infrastructure as code scanning (a CSPM function) (a CWPP function)

Image assurance: Container construction (CWPP)

Deployment and beyond: automated micro-segmentation and API protection, posture management and entity behaviour analytics (CSPM), and Kubernetes runtime assurance and virtual machine protection (CWPP) (CSNS)

By combining all of these tasks into one comprehensive platform, DevSecOps processes become more frictionless, contextual insights are made possible, and the company's overall security posture is enhanced. Organisations can benefit from CNAPPs in several ways when it comes to cloud-native application security. Several advantages include:

fewer cloud misconfigurations reduce the risk of cybersecurity risks.
automates security-related processes to cut down on human error and increase accuracy.
allows for quick response to hazards and influences decision-making by providing combined and unique visibility of risks and precise information.
eliminates the need to run and manage several cloud security products, which reduces complexity and overhead.
reduces the number of bug fixes and merge/pull requests by discovering misconfigurations and potential threats in the CI/CD pipeline phases. 
This increases developer and DevOps team productivity.
