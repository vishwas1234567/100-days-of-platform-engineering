# Kubernetes CI/CD

Kubernetes has an extensive API and developer-friendly features, Kubernetes is currently the top container management software. You can build applications that run on both private clouds and public clouds using Kubernetes. Its out-of-the-box capabilities enable it to distribute and maintain the availability of hundreds of instances across data centres.

More autonomy is needed when creating and deploying applications in order to match Kubernetes' level of automation. The greatest cloud-native and contemporary methods for creating, testing, and releasing apps with the least amount of human intervention are continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD). 

The manual procedures of compiling, testing, verifying, and deploying the most recent changes from the source code repository to the cluster are replaced by CI/CD technologies using a pipeline technique. As seen in the graphic below, Kubernetes requires the extension of CI/CD pipelines with a container registry, configuration management, Helm, and different cluster environments.


We will talk about the difficulties and ideal procedures for CI/CD pipelines for Kubernetes in this blog article. We'll also provide a list of well-known technologies you shouldn't overlook while setting up a productive CI/CD pipeline for Kubernetes. 


## Kubernetes CI/CD Pipelines Challenges

Due to the architecture of microservices and Kubernetes' erratic behaviour, designing and using a CI/CD pipeline is difficult. Therefore, if we had to categorise the difficulties with a Kubernetes CI/CD pipeline, we would do so in the following three groups: 

`Automated testing:` When developing and deploying dependable cloud applications, automated testing is essential. Before proceeding to the pipeline's next stages, you should properly test every developer's commit. When taking into account the integrations of several cloud providers and simulating the Kubernetes API, this can be difficult.

Kubernetes offers scalable and dependable deployment APIs so that your apps may be released to the cloud without any downtime. It also supports rollback. Therefore, cloud-native deployment tactics like rolling upgrades, blue/green, or A/B testing should still be included in CD workflows. In case issues arise during deployment, the pipeline should also roll back to the "last working" version. As a result, it's crucial to establish an automated deployment and rollback method in your pipelines.  
   
`Scalability:` Kubernetes will house tens or even hundreds of apps when it is used in production. The CI/CD technologies you are utilising in that situation will be monitoring a sizable number of source-code repositories and running numerous pipeline instances concurrently.


As a result, you must plan your CI/CD pipeline with scalability in mind and set aside enough resources for its staff.  
These difficulties demonstrate that creating and putting into place a good CI/CD pipeline for Kubernetes is not an easy task. There are, however, established best practises, which we'll go through in the section below.  

Kubernetes CI/CD Pipelines Best Practises
For your Kubernetes CI/CD pipelines, you should adhere to the following three best practises:

**GitOps:** Using the source version control system, particularly Git, GitOps is one of the newest methods for managing infrastructure and cloud-native apps. All application and pipeline configurations are stored in Git with the application's source code in this method. 

Application release, upgrade, and rollback techniques are referred to as deployment strategies. The techniques blue/green, canary, and A/B testing are well-known. The tactics you select for deployment must be incorporated into your CD pipelines since they can reduce failure and downtime risks.  
Overall observability: The conduits that connect your source code to Kubernetes clusters are CI/CD pipelines. As a result, you must keep an eye on the pipeline's progress and send out notifications and alerts to the relevant parties. Because you won't be able to produce new releases or bugfix patches if the pipeline stages fail, observability of the CI/CD systems is crucial.

**GitLab CI**


GitLab is the second most popular source-code hosting service, and it also provides a full-featured CI/CD tool. From a CI perspective, it implements all the popular features, including build, test, and validation. In addition, it offers crucial elements in the CD field, such as cluster management and canary deployments. GitLab CI is one of the leading solutions for Kubernetes CI/CD pipelines—and, of course, if you are storing your source code in GitLab. 

**Jenkins (Jenkins X)**


Jenkins is one of the most widely known CI tools on the market, with its origins in Java. However, here we are highlighting Jenkins X, a complete CI/CD tool focused on Kubernetes. Jenkins X provides a highly opinionated approach to creating and deploying Kubernetes applications. It is extendable with the other CI/CD tools and cloud providers, but is not mature enough to be a reliable and solid CI/CD tool for your Kubernetes clusters.

**Argo CD**

Argo CD is a declarative continuous delivery tool focused on Kubernetes. It fetches the declarative application definitions from the source-code repository and builds and installs them to the cluster. In other words, it implements the GitOps pattern and works on the cluster side. Therefore, unlike other tools, Argo CD is also directly installed in the Kubernetes cluster. It has an active community and is highly adopted, so it’s worth checking if you want a tool with a GitOps mindset. 

**Spinnaker**

Spinnaker is a CD tool created by Netflix and released as open-source in 2015. It focuses on managing the infrastructure and deployment cycle of applications; therefore, it is mainly categorized as a CD tool. It provides multi-cloud integrations, such as Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry. It’s a solid CD tool, but is highly sophisticated and most appropriate for large organizations.

**CI GitLab**


The second-most well-liked source-code hosting service, GitLab, also offers a fully functional CI/CD tool. It incorporates all of the well-liked CI functions, such as build, test, and validation. Additionally, it provides essential CD-related components like cluster management and canary deployments. One of the best options for Kubernetes CI/CD pipelines is GitLab CI, which is obviously true if you save your source code there as well. 


***(Jenkins X) Jenkins**


With its roots in Java, Jenkins is one of the most well-known CI tools available. But in this case, we're focusing on Jenkins X, a complete CI/CD solution designed specifically for Kubernetes. A very opinionated method for developing and deploying Kubernetes applications is offered by Jenkins X. Although it can be extended to work with additional CI/CD tools and cloud providers, it is not yet developed enough to be a dependable and robust CI/CD tool for Kubernetes clusters.


**Argo CD**


A declarative continuous delivery tool with a Kubernetes focus is called Argo CD. The declarative application definitions are downloaded from the source-code repository, where they are then built and installed on the cluster. In other words, it operates on the cluster side and applies the GitOps pattern. Argo CD is consequently installed directly in the Kubernetes cluster, unlike other utilities. If you're looking for a tool with a GitOps attitude, it's worth looking into because it has a vibrant community and is widely used. 


**Spinnaker**


Netflix produced the CD tool known as Spinnaker, which was made available as open-source in 2015. It is primarily categorised as a CD tool because it focuses on managing application infrastructure and deployment cycles. It offers multi-cloud integrations, including those for Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes. It's a reliable CD tool, but it's really advanced and best suited for big businesses.You don't need to start from scratch when it comes to developing your CI/CD software because there are already some well-known solutions that may assist you in adhering to these best practises.


Tools for Kubernetes CI/CD 
Let's examine the five most well-liked Kubernetes CI/CD tools available today, along with use cases.

**Github Actions**


The most popular source-code hosting service nowadays is GitHub. Additionally, it offers GitHub Actions, a hosted CI/CD platform that automates software development, test, and deployment using GitHub repository-based source code. Since GitHub Actions focuses primarily on CI, some CD capabilities like deployment tactics and cluster management are absent. If you keep your source code on GitHub, it is still worthwhile to look at.  CI GitLab
The second-most well-liked source-code hosting service, GitLab, also offers a fully functional CI/CD tool. It incorporates all of the well-liked CI functions, such as build, test, and validation.

Additionally, it provides essential CD-related components like cluster management and canary deployments. One of the best options for Kubernetes CI/CD pipelines is GitLab CI, which is obviously true if you save your source code there as well.
